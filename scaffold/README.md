# Cerebral CLI

### React by default
The project runs with React by default and hot replacement of changes to the modules

### CSS Modules
CSS files loaded into components are locally scoped and you can point to class names with javascript. You can also compose classes together, also from other files. These are also hot loaded. Read more about them [here](http://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules).

### Hot reloading
Any changes to React components will instantly update in the browser, but changes to other code will require you to do a refresh. Webpack tells you about this in the devtools console of the browser. Soon the boilerplate will automatically to a full refresh when this occurs, just waiting for an update :-)
